by Karel Moricky (Str)
Version 1.02 (2011/6/16)


-------------
INSTALLATION:
-------------
Copy file 'stra_debug2.pbo' into your ARMA 2 addons folder
('C:\Program Files\Bohemia Interactive\ArmA 2\AddOns' with default path)


-------------
USAGE:
-------------
During game, press Escape (to get into pause menu)
and Enter (to open console itself).

Top set of fields are for checking values
(upper field is input, lower one is output).
Values are checked automatically every 1/10 second.

Bottom set is for executing expressions.
Just type some command there and press "Exec" button on right.
Alternatively, you can use Ctrl+1 to Ctrl+6 keys to execute expressions.

All values are saved even after closing the console,
but only until game is shut down.

The console works in SP, MP and in 3D editor.

Happy debugging ;)
