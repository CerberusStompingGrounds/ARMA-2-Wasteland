player createDiaryRecord["Wasteland",["Hints & Tips","
<br/>
- At the start of the game, spread out and find supplies because supplies are valuable<br/><br/>
- Players randomly spawn in and around towns and could even spawn inside your base, should you set it up in a town.<br/><br/>
- If you perform a ground insertion, you will be automatically placed near a vehicle.<br/><br/>
- When you set up a base, never leave your supplies unguarded!<br/><br/>
- There are missions with hostile AI which will protect the mission, be aware of them<br/><br/>
- Deployed vehicles despawn if you move 100m away from them<br/><br/>

player CreateDiaryRecord["Beacons",["Beacon Information","
<br/>
- There are 3 types of beacons; Air, Ground, and Base.<br/><br/>
- Block radius is the minimum distance an enemy has to be to block player spawning<br/><br/>
- Air Beacons are purchased General Stores<br/><br/>
- Air Beacons have a block radius of 400m and an audible beep of around 200m<br/><br/>
- When spawning on an Air beacon, the beacon will spawn you approximately 500m in the air<br/><br/>
- Make sure to open your parachute least 120m from the ground to avoid death death<br/><br/>
- Higher speeds while falling may require a higher parachute-opening distance.<br/><br/>
- Air Beacons make a noise that can be heard from around 100m away, so place them carefully!<br/><br/>
- Ground beacons are purchased in General Stores<br/><br/>
- Ground beacons have a block radius of 100m and make an audible beep from approximately the same distance<br/><br/>
- Base beacons are purchased in General Stores.<br/>
- Base beacons have a radar and alert you to any enemies within a 125m radius.<br/><br/>
- Spawning on a Base Beacon will spawn you at ground level with no need for parachute timing.<br/><br/>
- For $100 you can redeploy to any spawnable location<br/><br/>
