"]];player createDiaryRecord["Wasteland",["Hints & Tips","
<br/>
At the start of the game, spread out and find supplies before worrying about where to establish a meeting place or a base, supplies are important and very valuable.<br/><br/>
When picking a base location, it is best advised to pick a place that is out of the way and not so obvious such as airports, cities, castles, etc.<br/><br/>
Remember players randomly spawn in and around towns and could even spawn inside your base should you set it up in a town.<br/><br/>
If you perform a ground insertion, you will be automatically placed near a vehicle. Be sure to look around for supplies before giving up.<br/><br/>
When you set up a base, never leave your supplies unguarded, one guard will suffice, but it is recommended you have at least 2, maybe 3 guards at base at all times.<br/><br/>
There are AI characters that spawn with missions and will protect the mission objectives with deadly force, be aware of them.<br/><br/>
Vehicles deployed from your inventory will despawn if you move more than 100m away from them.<br/><br/>

"]];player CreateDiaryRecord["Beacons",["Beacon Information","
<br/>
There are three types of beacons; Air, Ground, and Base.<br/>
Block radius is the minimum distance an enemy has to be to block player spawning.<br/>
Air beacons are the most common as they come with the two highest donation tiers. But are purchasable in general stores at a cost of $4000<br/>
Air beacons have a block radius of 400m and an audible beep of around 200m.<br/>
When spawning on an Air beacon, the beacon will spawn you approximately 500m in the air and allow you to guide yourself toward whatever direction you deem appropriate.<br/>
Make sure to open your parachute somewhere between at least 120m in order to avoid falling to your death. Higher speeds while falling may require a higher parachute-opening distance.<br/>
Air beacons produce an audible beep that can be heard from around 100m away, so place them carefully!<br/><br/>
Ground beacons are the significantly safer cousins of the Air beacon, but are substantially rarer, as they are only purchasable in general stores at a cost of $2000 and do not come in any donator loadouts.<br/>
Ground beacons have a block radius of 100m and make an audible beep from approximately the same distance.<br/>
Spawning on a ground beacon will spawn you at ground level with no need for parachute timing.<br/><br/>

Base beacons are a powerful tool vastly underused by players.<br/>
Base beacons are purchasable in general stores at a cost of $8000.<br/>
Base beacons have a radar not unlike a town and alert you to any enemies within a 125m radius of the beacon.<br/>
Spawning on a Base Beacon will spawn you at ground level with no need for parachute timing.<br/>
Base beacons will not allow spawning if an enemy is within a 75m radius.<br/>
WARNING!<br/>
The base beacon will create a white and black marker on the map advertising your position to the rest of the server.<br/>
With great power comes great responsibility, so only use these beacons when you're ready to be attacked!<br/>
The base beacon will allow you, for $100, to redeploy to any location on the map that you can spawn at.<br/>
This is particularly powerful when using two base beacons in conjunction with one another, as it allows you to quickly travel between the two, without the need to repurchase weapons and gear.<br/>
Players have reported that it is possible to carry objects such as ammunition crates and base parts while redeploying, so long as a ground type spawn is chosen.<br/>
Spawning on towns, ground beacons, or base beacons is recommended.<br/>
Spawning on an air beacon, random HALO, or in an air vehicle is not recommended.<br/>
Players report that airborne spawning causes the loss of the carried item.<br/>

Stalk and Strike Gaming started out innocently enough as a group of gamers tired of dealing with poor servers.<br/>
We decided to take action, and make our own community. We pride ourselves on providing a fun gameplay experience, with an Admin team that cares.<br/>
Our Administration team works diligently to keep our servers high performance, and well administered.<br/>
Trouble makers are quickly dealt with as the situation calls for. We provide quality servers on top-end hardware to ensure great performance.<br/>
This community is fully supported by our VIP subscriber base. Thanks to this fantastic group of supporters, we are able to keep bringing an awesome service to the community.<br/><br/>

FAQ<br/>
Q. Can enemies hear me on side VON?<br/>
A. Yes, even if you're talking in side VON or even vehicle VON if a player is close enough to you they can still hear you talking.<br/>
<br/><br/>
Q. Where can I get a gun?<br/>
A. The best place to buy weapons is from the loadout screen before you spawn, but weapons are also found in multiple places including ammo caches that randomly spawn around the map inside of towns, in the gear section of the vehicles, which also randomly spawn around the map in towns. 
   The last place to find a gun would be at the gunshops located throughout the map. You can also find them on dead players whose bodies have not yet been looted.
<br/><br/>
Q. What are the circles on the map?<br/>
A. The circles represent town limits. If friendly soldiers are in a town, you can spawn there from the re-spawn menu; however if there is an enemy presence, you will not be able to spawn there.
<br/><br/>
Q. I saw someone breaking a rule, what do I do?<br/>
A. Join the support chat or Discord Voice Server is the fastest way. http://www.stalkandstrikegaming.com and click support chat.
<br/><br/>
Q. What's that white castle on the map?
A. That's a base flag and shows the location of a player controlled base, be careful as Base flags get a radar circle like towns notifying them of your presence.
